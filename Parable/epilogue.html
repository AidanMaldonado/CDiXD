        <p id="HolyCow">Others tell the story in a different way. In this world there cannot be two identical things; it was enough, we are told, for the Poet merely to utter the <b onclick="myFunction()" id="Poet">poem</b> for the palace to disappear, as if struck and razed to the ground by the last syllable. Clearly, such legends are no more than literary fiction. The Poet was the Emperor’s slave and died as such; his composition fell into <span id="opacity60">oblivion</span> because it deserved <span id="opacity60">oblivion</span>, and his descendants are still searching for – but will never find – the word for the universe.
