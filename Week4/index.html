<h1> <br>
    Annabel Lee <br>
    by Edgar Allen Poe
</h1>

<p style="color:white;">
    It was <em>many</em> and <em><span>many</span></em> a year ago, <br>
    <br>
    In a kingdom by the sea,  <br> 
    <br>
    That a maiden there lived whom you may know <br>
    <br>
    By the name of <span>Annabel Lee</span>;  <br> 
    <br>
    And this maiden <em>she lived with no other</em> <strong>thought</strong><br>
    <br>
    Than to love and be loved by me. <br>
    </p>
<p style="color:white;">
    <em>I</em> was a child and <em>she</em> was a child, <br>
    <br>
    In this kingdom by the sea, <br>
    <br>
    But we loved with a love that was more than love- <br>
    <br>
    I and my Annabel Lee- <br>
    <br>
    With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven <br>
    <br>
    Coveted her and me. <br>
    </p>
<p style="color:white;">
    And this was the reason that, long ago, <br>
    <br>
    In this kingdom by the sea, <br>
    <br>
    A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling <br>
    <br>
    My beautiful Annabel Lee; <br>
    <br>
    So that her highborn kinsmen came <br>
    <br>
    And bore her away from me, <br>
    <br>
    To shut her up in a sepulchre <br>
    <br>
    In this kingdom by the sea. <br>
    </p>
<p style="color:white;">
    The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, <br>
    <br>
    Went envying her and me- <br>
    <br>
    Yes!- that was the reason (as all men know, <br>
    <br>
    In this kingdom by the sea) <br>
    <br>
    That the wind came out of the bloud by night, <br>
    <br>
    Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. <br>
    </p>
<p style="color:white;">
    But our love it was stronger by far than the love <br>
    <br>
    Of those who were older than we- <br>
    <br>
    Of many far wiser than we <br>
    <br>
    And neither the angels in Heaven above <br>
    <br>
    Nor the demons down under the sea <br>
    <br>
    Can ever dissever my soul from the soul <br>
    <br>
    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; <br>
    </p>
 <p style="color:white;">
    For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams <br>
    <br>
    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; <br>
    <br>
    And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes <br>
    <br>
    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; <br>
    <br>
    And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side <br>
    <br>
    Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride, <br>
    <br>
    In her sepulchre there by the sea <br>
    <br>
    In her tomb by the sounding sea. <br>
    <br>
    </p>
